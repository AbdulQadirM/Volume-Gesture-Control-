# Volume-Gesture-Control:
The script is a "Gesture Volume Control" program that uses hand gestures captured by a camera to control the volume of the speakers. It utilizes the OpenCV library to process video frames and the handLMmodule, a custom module, to detect hands within the frames. The position of the hand is then used to control the volume of the speakers using the pycaw library. The program also displays a volume bar and percentage on the screen.
